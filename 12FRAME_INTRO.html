		a rigid structure that surrounds something such as a picture, door, or windowpane.
		
		<h3>Frames definition for html:</h3><br>
		The <
		frame> tag defines one particular window (frame) within a <
		frameset>.<br>
		Each <
		frame> in a <
		frameset> can have different attributes, such as border, scrolling, the ability to resize, etc.
		
		<h3>Usage of frames:</h3>
			HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.
